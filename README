@DESCRIPTION@

To prevent high system load because of too many messages being loaded
at once, the administrator can configure the maximum number of messages
in a thread for which this link is still shown.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "@MODULE_ID@" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "@TITLE@".


Localization:
-------------

This module supports localization through the language files in the
lang directory. If your language is not supported by the module, copy
english.php to <yourlanguage>.php and update the language strings in it.

If you create a new language file, please post it to the Phorum forums,
so it can be added to this distribution.
