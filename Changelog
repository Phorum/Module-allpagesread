2006-02-24 v1.0.4, Maurice Makaay

    - In the initial module, there was a hard-coded check if the user
      was logged in or not. The mod would not work for anonymous visitors.

2006-01-23 v1.0.1, Maurice Makaay

    - The combination of threaded list + flat read made the "All" link
      not be displayed on the read page. This has been fixed.

    - The configured maximum number of messages in the settings now hides
      the "All" link in case the number of messages in the whole thread
      is higher than this maximum.

    - Use of full PHP open tag (<?php).

    - Use of phorum_admin_okmsg() and phorum_admin_error() in settings.php.
